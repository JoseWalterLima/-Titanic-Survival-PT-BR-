        "**Analisando os dados iniciais, podemos perceber algumas características gerais dos passageiros do Titanic**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1)** Haviam no navio desde bebês, com menos de um ano de vida, até idosos, sendo que o passageiro mais velho tinha 80 anos. Mas em geral os passageiros eram mais jovens, sendo a média de idade de 29,7 anos, e 75% dos passageiros tendo até 38 anos.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2)** O preço da passagem variou bastante, provavelmente em função da classe em que o passageiro viajava. O valor médio da passagem paga para viajar no Titanic foi de 32,20 dólares, mas 75% dos passageiros pagaram até 31 dólares. Os bilhetes mais caros custaram 512 dólares.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3)** A grande maioria dos passageiros viajava sem familiares (marido, esposa ou irmão) e não tinham dependentes (filhos e pais idosos).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4)** Mais da metade dos passageiros (55%) viajava na terceira classe. A segunda classe tinha menos passageiros que a primeira.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5)** Praticamente 65% dos passageiros eram homens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6)** As mulheres sobrevivem em proporção muito maior que os homens.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7)** Existe uma correlação entre a Classe do passageiro e sua probabilidade de sobreviver."

        "É bastante diferente a distribuição da sobrevivência para passageiros que tinham o registro da idade e para os que não tinham. Além disso é perceptível que a única faixa etária com volume relevante de passageiros e que foi determinante para a sobreviência, foi a faixa etária de crianças pequenas. Dessa forma, serão criadas 3 faixas etárias para os passageiros: **0**: Crianças de 0 a 6 anos, **1**: Passageiros acima dos 6 anos e **2**: Passegeiros sem o registro da idade. Este procedimento pode ser mais adequado, uma vez que foi percebida uma correlação clara entre a Idade e a Sobrevivência, para justificar deixar a idade como variável contínua."

Por isso, mesmo que a correlação entre a Cabine e a Target pareça ser fraca, vale a pena determinar se o passageiro tem a indicação de cabine ou não. Vou substituir os passageiros sem Cabine por 0 e todos o que tem a marcação terão valor 1."

Isso pode ser percebido avaliando a coluna do Ticket e também do nome, onde a primeira palavra do nome parece indicar a família. A relação entre o Ticket (família) e a sobrevivência é muito clara, sendo que em praticamente todos os casos avaliados, todos os familiares morreram. Mas nos casos em que o Ticket é o mesmo mas as pessoas não são da mesma família, parece não haver relação entre sobreviver ou não.
